Robotario. Is a robotic testbed with applications in research and university teaching. It allows verifying the correct operation of multiagent algorithms beyond more simulations. A series of mobile robots have been developed and built which incorporate a velocity controller, a communications system and a location system onboard. A global location system has been designed and programmed that can identify and locate every robot in the Robotario. A server has been programmed and designed that gets data from the robots involved in the tests and gives them instructions so they can perform the respective algorithm.
